## 📖 Overview

NovaFlow Store is a **complete, database‑driven online shop** built with a custom JavaScript SPA frontend and a PHP/MySQL backend.  
It features **42 uniquely branded tech products** (each with AI‑generated images), a seamless shopping experience from browsing to checkout, and **three hidden Easter eggs** that reward curious visitors.

## 🐞 Known Issues & Notes
- The Easter eggs are **intentionally hidden** – there are no visible links or hints.
- The **Tailwind CSS runtime** is used for on‑demand styling; this triggers a console warning about production use (harmless).
- The original `_sdk` scripts from the template have been removed to prevent 404 errors.
- The CSP (Content Security Policy) warning about `eval()` is caused by a single inline PHP script and does **not** affect functionality.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- [ ] Real **reviews & ratings** system (database table already exists)
- [ ] **Order history** for logged‑in users
- [ ] Extract JavaScript to external files
- [ ] Add **forgot password** demo
- [ ] Advanced search with server‑side filtering
